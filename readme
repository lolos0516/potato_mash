1.	MASTER_GENOPHENO.zip
 a.	MASTER_GENOPHENO: this file contains the SNP genotypes (centred around zero, with chromosomes followed by positions on the header)
 b.	crispBLUP_OTF: phenotypes we will be looking at, i.e., fry colour
 c.	popOL/pop/line are descriptions of population/sample identifiers (we can worry about this later)   
2.	FRY_SMAP_output.zip
 a.	haplotypes_c20_f5_m0_discrete_calls_filtered.tsv: this will be the file we use. This contains (filtered) haplotypes. 
 b.	Other files contains unfiltered haplotype calls and read counts and haplotype frequencies (could also be useful if building GRMs)
 c.	More info on SMAP can be found in https://ngs-smap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
